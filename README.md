# Dice-Simulator
A website application that was written in C# using Visual Studio Code. The program simulates the probability rolling of two six-sided dice. It calculates and displays the frequencies and percentages of each die after each roll. A die class is used to simulate random roll of the dice and the images of the corresponding dice are shown.

Input - Number of times to roll the two dice.<br/>
Output - Frequencies and percents of each face rolled.

This project was made possible from the lectures given by Niko Cuvileski at Edmonds Community College.<br/> This course inspired me to build upon my knowledge of C++ and dive further <br/> into software engineering. By getting hands-on experience with front-end C# development.
