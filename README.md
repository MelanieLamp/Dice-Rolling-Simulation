# Dice-Simulator
This application simulates the probability rolling of two six-sided dice. <br/>It calculates and displays the frequencies and percentages of each die after each roll. 
<br/>A die class is used to simulate random roll of the dice and the images of the <br/> corresponding dice are shown.

## Acknowledgements
This project was made possible from the lectures given by Niko Cuvileski at Edmonds Community College.<br/> This course inspired me to build upon my knowledge of C++ and dive further <br/> into software engineering. By getting hands-on experience with front-end and back-end in C# development.
